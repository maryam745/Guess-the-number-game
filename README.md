# Guess-the-number-game
This is a simple “Guess the Number” game built with Python and Flet. The app picks a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it. After each guess, the game gives a hint—whether to guess higher or lower—and keeps track of the number of attempts. Once the correct number is guessed, it shows the total attempts taken.
