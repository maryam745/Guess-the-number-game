# Guess the Number Game (Beginner Level)

## Description

This is a simple “Guess the Number” game built using Python and Flet. The app randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it. After each guess, the game provides a hint—telling the player to guess higher or lower—and keeps track of the number of attempts. Once the correct number is guessed, it displays the total attempts taken.

## Features

* Random number generation between 1 and 100.
* Basic higher/lower hints.
* Tracks number of attempts.
* Simple and beginner-friendly interface using Flet.

## How to Run

2. Open a terminal or command prompt in that folder.
3. Run the game using:

## How to Play

1. Enter a number between 1 and 100 in the input field.
